/**
 * @typedef {Object} RendezvousPrivateService A closely-held service associated
 * with a specific Agoric peer.  It allows you to exchange values (possibly
 * ocaps) with another peer, given a third-party that can exchange the other
 * side's address strings between you.
 *
 * Consider the Agoric chain, A, and two ag-solos attached to the chain: B and
 * C.  Given a Dapp UI, D, that can speak pure data (not ocaps) to both B and C,
 * you have the following architecture:
 *
 * ```
 *             A Agoric chain
 *           // \\
 *  ag-solo B     C ag-solo
 *           \   /
 *             D Dapp UI
 * ```
 * where the double-slashes indicate the ocap connections and the single-slashes
 * indicate the pure data connections.  If B and C are willing, D can get B's
 * rendezvous address, then tell C to initiate a rendezvous to B's address.  C
 * will return its own rendezvous address to D, who then tells B to complete the
 * rendezvous to C's address.
 *
 * The on-chain rendezvous namespace matches the two addresses to each other,
 * sending B's specified object to C and C's specified object to B.  That
 * effectively creates a connection between B and C, exposing only the methods
 * that they choose, and (if the rendezvous addresses are assigned by A and
 * globally unique, such as public keys signing their connection to A),
 * guaranteeing that only B and C have initial access to those objects and that
 * they know D introduced them.
 *
 * A strength of the system is that the rendezvous will fail if B and C are
 * *not* connected to the same chain.  This helps D ensure that B and C have the
 * same specific on-chain services, such as a common Zoe.
 *
 * @property {() => string} getNamespaceName get the name of the rendezvous
 * namespace.  This will typically be the chain identifier, like `testnet-4` for
 * the Agoric testnet, or `mySim` for the simulated chain.  It is not
 * necessarily unique.
 * @property {() => PeerAddress} getLocalAddress get the address string for this
 * private service
 * @property {(peerAddrs: PeerAddresses, sendToPeer: any) => Rendezvous}
 * startRendezvous create a new rendezvous instance for this local address,

 * and sends `sendToPeer` to that peer, throwing an exception if no peer
 * completed the rendezvous
